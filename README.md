# Algoritmos e Estruturas de Dados (AED) - Year 2, Semester 1 (Y2S1)

This repository contains all the exercises and assessments of the UC Algorithms and Data Structures, taught by [Pedro Ribeiro](https://www.dcc.fc.up.pt/~pribeiro/) and [Ana Paula Rocha](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/pt/func_geral.formview?p_codigo=211625) at [Integrated Master in Informatics and Computing Engineering](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/pt/cur_geral.cur_view?pv_curso_id=742) [MIEIC] at the [Faculty of Engineering of the University of Porto](https://sigarra.up.pt/feup/pt/web_page.Inicial) [FEUP]. <br/>

## Here are several documents, namely:

### My Drafts <br/>
Pieces of code for exercises and assessments, notes that I take during practical classes and other experiences using C and C++ languages. It is an authentic disorganized notebook. <br/>

### Notes
Notes that I take during theoretical lectures.<br/>

### Exercises / Mooshak
Varied exercises of easy, medium and difficult level, about the subject taught in the present week. They complement the weekly work developed during the practical classes. <br/>

### Project 1 - Airline Database Management, AirED

A project done in one month with [Carolina Brandão](https://github.com/CarolBrandak) and [Gabriel Machado Jr.](https://github.com/gabrieltmjr). <br>
It is intended to implement an information management system that must store and manage information related to planes, flights, passengers and luggage.

Implemented features:
- [x] Simpler and non-recursive interface, based on the Stack data structure;
- [x] Efficient search to the nearest transport, using Binary Search Tree data structure;
- [x] Efficient search to flights, planes, services, luggage using linear-search in lists and binary-search in sorted vectors;
- [x] Two types of luggage: hand-luggage and hold-luggage, depends on the user input and volume/weight proprieties;
- [x] Automatic compound unique IDs, to better performance and avoid collisions in system population and manipulation;
- [x] Secure Data during the execution of program, using redundancy based on [RAID 1](https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAID);
- [x] [ON DELETE CASCADE](https://www.mysqltutorial.org/mysql-on-delete-cascade/) implicit behavior, activation whenever delete certain component, based on SQL databases management systems (DBMS);

Project Grade: 18,6 / 20

### Project 2 - STCP++

A project done in two weeks with [Carolina Brandão](https://github.com/CarolBrandak) and [Gabriel Machado Jr.](https://github.com/gabrieltmjr). <br>

Project Grade: X / 20
